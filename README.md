# Overview of Interactive Venn Diagram Generator

### Why?

Hello, my name is Hunter Wilhelm and welcome to my portfolio! I am trying to master [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/).

I wanted to learn [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) because, from what I have seen, it is more performant that p5.js.

### What problem does this solve?

I was having a hard time generating category n Venn Diagrams in my SVG editor.

### How to use

* Press the up or down arrow keys to increase or decrease the number of circles in the Venn Diagram
* For faster input, press enter to type a number of circles.
* Press the left or right arrow keys to increase or decrease the spacing between the circles.
* Press p or P to save as SVG. You can paste it into a program like Figma to clean it up.

### Warning

* Beware of the statistics at the bottom, it shows how quickly each iteration is taking.
* Even though it might take time to generate the paths, the end result is very performant since it is Paper.js and has
  the same philosophy has SVG.

### Hosted Demo
